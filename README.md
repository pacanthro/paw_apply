# PAWApply
PAWApply is a Django based website for Furry Conventions to facilitate helping Attendees apply for:

* Dealers Den (Shopping District/Merchants)
* Volunteering
* Party Floor
* Panels
* Dance Comp

With the exception of Volunteers all of these can be toggled on and off per event.

Additionaly it's designed to automate handling of each of them. With a robust management console its very easy to approve an application,
or request a payment. A lot of steps have automated emails sent as well.

This was originally designed for Pacific Anthropomorphics Weekend ([PAWCon](https://pacanthro.org))
